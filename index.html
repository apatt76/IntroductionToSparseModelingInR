Have you ever wanted to infer ecological insights from big data? Here is a great chance to expand your knowledge of how to analyze big 
datasets with many predictors and to overcome traditional statistical challenges such as overfitting and
poor predictive performance. We will teach you how to leverage sparse modeling approaches using accessible R packages to glean value
from big data in our interactive workshop tailored for ecologists across all levels. Participants will learn about sparse 
modeling techniques, create SuSiE (susieR) and lasso (glmnet) scripts in R, and visualize and interpret fitted models during
our live coding session.
